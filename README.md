Python Notes App

Housemaiden throw away my paper post-it notes, I got mad and wrote a very simple python app to store notes.
Store index on a document (json syntax) file, and files in txt files on filesystem.
I am using it on a cloud storage directory (ie Dropbox/Copy), to make sure to not lose my notes again.

Requires a /docs folder and wxpython, you can build an exe with py2exe and the provided setup.py
